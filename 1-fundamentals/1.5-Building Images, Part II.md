# Building Images, Part II

## Layering

When we build a Docker Image, each of our keywords are processed in steps. Using the example above, we can see that `FROM` is "Step 1", and our `RUN` commands are "Step 2" and "Step 3".

Each step produces an image. It is combinations of these images that we consider layering. Lets take a look at the images on our machine:

```shell
$ docker images
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
my_new_image        latest              4435bb751a01        12 minutes ago      4.805 MB
elasticsearch       2                   83ed90c49472        4 days ago          342.8 MB
alpine              3.3                 695f3d04125d        4 days ago          4.805 MB
```

In proper Docker-customery fashion, lets try that again with the all-powerful `-a` flag:

```shell
$ docker images -a
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED              SIZE
my_new_image        latest              4435bb751a01        About a minute ago   4.805 MB
<none>              <none>              e2d914029153        About a minute ago   4.805 MB
elasticsearch       2                   83ed90c49472        4 days ago           342.8 MB
alpine              3.3                 695f3d04125d        4 days ago           4.805 MB
```

Oooh. What's  that `<none>` image? That's our interim layer! Lets run the build again.

```shell
$ docker build -t my_new_image .
Sending build context to Docker daemon 122.4 kB
Step 1 : FROM alpine:3.3
 ---> 695f3d04125d
Step 2 : RUN echo -e '#!/usr/bin/env sh\necho Hello, world!' > /bin/runme.sh
 ---> Using cache
 ---> e2d914029153
Step 3 : RUN chmod +x /bin/runme.sh
 ---> Using cache
 ---> 4435bb751a01
Successfully built 4435bb751a01
```

See how quickly that built? It was instant. That's because nothing has changed and it used our cached images. Notice the IDs in the output? `e2d914029153` and `4435bb751a01`. 

The only reason our final image, `4435bb751a01` doesn't have a repository and tag value of `<none>`, is because we tagged it as `my_new_image`. When you build and specify a tag, the tag will be applied to the final image.
