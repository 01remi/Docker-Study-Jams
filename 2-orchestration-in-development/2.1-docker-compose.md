# Docker Compose

Lets face it ... our applications have dependencies, lots of them. We have databases, caches, queues, and whatever framework is flavour of the week in Javascript land. On-boarding new developers is a nightmare! Well, until Docker Compose came along :happy:

Lets assume we're working on a PHP application, pretty standard setup: MySQL database, Redis and Varnish ... because PHP can't scale without Varnish :smile:

In the past we would have provided a `README` that was hundreds of lines long. In the not-as-far-back-past some of us adopted `Vagrant` and we started providing hundreds, if not thousands, of lines of provisioning code. Those days are over :shocked:

## What is Docker Compose?

Docker Compose is an application that allows us to provide a `YAML` configuration file that describes our applications environment. Using this `YAML` file, Compose will launch all the Docker Containers you need. What's more? It'll configure any shared volumes, networks and environment variables your applications need to work efficiently.

Sounds too good to be true, right?

## Installing Docker Compose

```shell
$ curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.8.1/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` > /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
$ chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

## Example

This is an example `docker-compose.yml`. Put this in a directory and run `docker-compose up` and watch the magic happen.

```yaml
version: '2'

services:
  application:
    image: php:7-apache
  redis:
    image: redis:3.2-alpine
  mysql:
    image: mysql:5.7
```

### Configuring Services with Environment Variables

#### AKA "Being 12-Factor"

It's probably rather rare that we get away with specifying a service as simply an image. For instance, in order for our application to speak to mysql, we need to inject some credentials. Not only that, we've not even configured mysql with that knowledge yet.

One of the most important steps when setting up services with Docker Compose is getting environment variables into the system. This can be done by supplying the `environment` list to your service.

```yaml
version: '2'
services:
  mysql:
    image: mysql:5.7
    environment:
      MYSQL_USERNAME: username
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: password
```

### Tip

You can use environment variables already defined on your host with either of the following syntaxes:

```yaml
version: '2'
services:
  mysql:
    image: mysql:5.7
    environment:
      # This will use "MYSQL_USERNAME" as defined on the host
      MYSQL_USERNAME:
      # This will use "MYSQL_PASSWORD" as defined on the host
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: ${MYSQL_PASSWORD}
```

### Tip

You can test your configuraiton, and it's interpolated values:

### YAML Warning

Due to the `YAML` spec being absolutely crazy, there's a few ways of specifying our environment variables for Docker Compose. You'll come across all of them in the wild, but I would suggest picking one you like and sticking to that for projects within your control.

#### YAML List

```yaml
services:
  mysql:
    image: mysql:5.7
    environment:
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=my_database
```

#### YAML Dictionary

```yaml
services:
  mysql:
    image: mysql:5.7
    environment:
      MYSQL_DATABASE: my_database
```

#### YAML Inline Lists & Dictionaries ... sigh

```yaml
version: '2'
services:
  mysql:
    image: mysql:5.7
    environment: [ "MYSQL_DATABASE=my_database" ]
    environment: { MYSQL_DATABASE: my_database }
```
